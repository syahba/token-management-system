# Eco Token

## Problem Statement

**Problem in Indonesia:** Indonesia faces a significant waste management challenge, producing roughly 190,000 tons of waste daily with very low recycling rates. A key issue is that waste is not properly sorted at the source, making recycling more difficult.

**Who is affected?:** This problem affects everyoneâ€”households, local communities, waste collectors, and the overall environment.

**Why is this problem important?:** A lack of consistent motivation for citizens to sort waste at home is a major barrier to improving recycling efforts and reducing the country's waste crisis.

## Current Solution & Limitations

**How people solve this now:** The current incentives are often small cash payments or informal waste banks.

**What are the limitations?:** These solutions have limited reach, engaging only those who are already motivated. They lack a scalable, transparent system for tracking rewards and measuring the real environmental impact of waste collection.

## Solution Overview

**Smart Contract Solution:** The Eco Token is a blockchain-based reward system. It allows waste collectors to instantly reward people with digital tokens for bringing in sorted waste.

**Why it's better:** Using a blockchain makes all transactions transparent and tamper-proof. This not only motivates individuals with a new form of reward but also provides communities and governments with verifiable data to track their environmental impact.

## Value Proposition

**Benefits for users:**
* Users get tangible rewards in the form of tokens for doing the right thing.
* Tokens can be saved or redeemed for practical perks like discounts on groceries or utility bills.
* This system is more convenient and flexible than traditional cash-based methods.

**Benefits for the ecosystem:**
* Encourages higher quality waste sorting at the source.
* Provides transparent and accurate data for environmental reporting.
* Fosters community engagement and a sense of shared purpose through a gamified approach.
